# Utility-Boards
Printed curcuit boards designs and associated code for hobby and task related PCBs.

I created a few printed circuit boards to perform some simple tasks. Pending uploads:
  * Lighting - using motion sensing to control 12V LED strips (single-color or RGB). Used for under-counter task lighting (color fades to full white) and walkway lighting (on/off).
  * Power Alert - generate an alert (flashing LED and Piezo speaker) when USB or 5V power to the board is lost. It continues to blink after power is restored as a notification. A Li-Po battery provides backup power and is recharged by the board when power is restored.
  * Heater control - string multiple temperature sensors together with phone wire to control a heater. Used in outbuildings to prevent plumbing and fixtures from freezing.
